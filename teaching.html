        <h1>Teaching</h1>
        
        <h2>Teaching Overview</h2>
        <p>
            I am a computing academic with extensive teaching experience across artificial intelligence, cyber security, data analytics, human-centred computing, and IT
            governance. My teaching spans undergraduate and postgraduate programs in Australia and internationally, delivered through face-to-face, blended, and fully online modes.
            I emphasise industry-aligned skills, ethical and responsible use of AI, and authentic assessment grounded in real-world professional practice.
        </p>

        <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            My teaching philosophy is grounded in student-centred, applied learning that aligns clearly articulated learning outcomes with meaningful activities and assessments.
            I design learning experiences that balance strong theoretical foundations with hands-on problem solving, enabling students to develop both conceptual understanding
            and job-ready skills. I place particular emphasis on ethical awareness, security, and responsible use of technology, especially in AI-driven and data-intensive systems.
            My teaching is inclusive, reflective, and continuously refined based on feedback and evaluation.
        </p>
