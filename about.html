        <p>I am a Senior Research Fellow at the School of Electrical Engineering, Computing and Mathematical Sciences (EECMS)
            at Curtin University in Perth, with a past affiliation with the Optus-Curtin Centre of Excellence in AI. 
            My journey has taken me across renowned institutions like the Australian National University (ANU) and 
            Macquarie University, where I focused on pioneering research that integrates computer science with human health. 
            I earned my PhD in computer science from ANU, where I developed innovative machine learning models for affect detection. 
            My work is driven by a passion to leverage technology for meaningful applications in health and human well-being.</p>
        
        <p>Since 2012, I have taught over 20 university courses and supervised numerous students, including PhDs, master’s, and 
            honors students, at various institutions including the University of Information Technology & Sciences (UITS) and 
            Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET) in Bangladesh, as well as the University of Canberra, ANU, and 
            Curtin University. I am an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (AFHEA), awarded by the UK Advanced 
            Higher Education Academy. Through my teaching roles, I aim to foster critical thinking and innovation among students,
            drawing from my international experience and diverse academic background to enrich the learning environment.</p>
        
        <p>My research focuses on developing advanced technologies to address health-related challenges through responsible AI 
            and responsive AI frameworks. At Curtin University, I lead projects that create privacy-preserving AI approaches 
            for applications such as affective computing, emotion recognition, and predictive models for managing human 
            diseases. Previously, at ANU’s Biological Data Science Institute (BDSI) and as a Visiting Scientist at CSIRO, 
            I developed biologically informed machine learning models for predicting diseases in salmon and agricultural traits
            in wheat. My research spans a range of health-related AI applications, from diagnosing COVID-19 via acoustic 
            signals to building predictive models for individuals with chronic conditions like multiple sclerosis and diabetes.</p>
