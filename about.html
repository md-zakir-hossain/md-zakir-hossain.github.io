        <p>I am an Associate Professor at MBZUAI and a member of the Intelligent Visual Analytics Lab (IVAL). Previously, I was a Senior Scientist at Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence and a Research Scientist in the Computer Vision Research Group (CVRG) at Data61, CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization). I am also an adjunct faculty member at College of Electrical & Computer Science (CECS), Australian National University (ANU) since 2016. I was a research visitor at NICTA (National ICT Australia) in 2015 and also served as a research affiliate with Australian Center for Robotic Vision (ACRV).


I work on model generalization, multi-modal learning, learning from limited data (zero and few-shot learning), and continual life-long learning systems for computer vision problems. The above-mentioned tasks can help us realize intelligent autonomous systems that can better understand the real world for improved recognition, detection, segmentation, and detailed scene comprehension. I am also interested in the applications of vision and learning algorithms to earth observation and climate science.</p>
