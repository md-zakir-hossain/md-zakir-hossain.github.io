            <p>I am a Senior Research Fellow at <a href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/md-zakir-hossain-4fd95ece/" target="_blank">the School of Electrical Engineering, Computing and Mathematical Sciences (EECMS)</a>
                at Curtin University in Perth, with a past affiliation with <a href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/md-zakir-hossain-4fd95ece/" target="_blank">the Optus-Curtin Centre of Excellence in AI</a>. 
                Previously, I was a Research Follow in the Biological Data Science Institute (BDSI) at ANU and as a Visiting Scientist at CSIRO. I was also worked for Research School of Computer Science at ANU, Macquarie University, and University of Canberra in
                Australia, as well as KUET and UITS in Bangladesh. I am currently a Visiting Fellow at BDSI, ANU and a Visiting Scientist at Data61, CSIRO.</p>
        
            <p>Since 2012, I have taught over 20 university courses and supervised numerous students, including PhDs, master’s, and 
                honors students, at various institutions including the University of Information Technology & Sciences (UITS) and 
                Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET) in Bangladesh, as well as the University of Canberra, ANU, and 
                Curtin University. I am an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (AFHEA), awarded by the UK Advanced 
                Higher Education Academy. Through my teaching roles, I aim to foster critical thinking and innovation among students,
                drawing from my international experience and diverse academic background to enrich the learning environment.</p>
        
            <p>My research focuses on developing advanced technologies to address health-related challenges through responsible AI 
                and responsive AI frameworks. At Curtin University, I lead projects that create privacy-preserving AI approaches 
                for applications such as affective computing, emotion recognition, and predictive models for managing human 
                diseases. Previously, at ANU’s Biological Data Science Institute (BDSI) and as a Visiting Scientist at CSIRO, 
                I developed biologically informed machine learning models for predicting diseases in salmon and agricultural traits
                in wheat. My research spans a range of health-related AI applications, from diagnosing COVID-19 via acoustic 
                signals to building predictive models for individuals with chronic conditions like multiple sclerosis and diabetes.</p>
