        <p> I am a Senior Research Academic at <a href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/md-zakir-hossain-4fd95ece/" target="_blank">the School of Electrical Engineering, Computing and Mathematical Sciences (EECMS)</a>, 
            Curtin University, with a past affiliation with the Optus-Curtin Centre of Excellence in AI. I also serve as a Visiting Fellow at the Australian National University (ANU)’s 
            <a href="https://bdsi.anu.edu.au/people">Biological Data Science Institute (BDSI)</a> and a Visiting Scientist at <a href="https://people.csiro.au/H/Z/zakir-hossain">Data61</a>, CSIRO. My research focuses on developing AI-driven solutions 
            for health informatics, affective computing, and privacy-preserving AI applications. With over a decade of experience in interdisciplinary research and teaching, I have contributed to machine learning, computer vision, and human-centered AI through academic, industry, and government collaborations.</p>
                        
        <p> Prior to joining Curtin University, I worked as a Research Fellow at <a href="https://bdsi.anu.edu.au/people">BDSI</a>, ANU and as a Visiting Scientist with 
            <a href="https://bdsi.anu.edu.au/people">the Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence Future Science Platforms (MLAI FSP)</a> and <a href="https://people.csiro.au/H/Z/zakir-hossain">Agriculture and Food business</a> unit at CSIRO. 
            I also served as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/healthy-people/centres/australian-institute-of-health-innovation/aihi-research-centres/health-informatics">the Centre for Health Informatics (CHI)</a>, 
            Macquarie University, Sydney. From 2018 to 2020, I worked as a Postdoctoral / Research Fellow and Lecturer at <a href="https://nceph.anu.edu.au/research/research-projects/our-health-our-hands-personalised-medicine-transforming-health-care">OHIOH (Our Health in Our Hands)</a> Grand Challenge and 
            <a href="https://comp.anu.edu.au/">the Research School of Computer Science (RSCS)</a>, ANU. Additionally, I worked as a Human-Centered Computing Support Officer at the <a href="https://comp.anu.edu.au/">RSCS</a>, ANU at the end of my PhD. 
            Before moving to Australia in 2015, I worked as a Lecturer and later as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering (EEE) at <a href="https://www.kuet.ac.bd/dept/eee">Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET)</a>, 
            Khulna, Bangladesh. Prior to that, I began my academic career as a Lecturer in EEE at the <a href="https://uits.edu.bd/department-of-electrical-electronic-engineering/"> University of Information Technology & Sciences (UITS)</a>, Dhaka, Bangladesh.</p>
        
        <p>Since 2012, I have taught 20+ university courses and supervised numerous PhD, master’s, and honors students at institutions in Australia and Bangladesh, including Curtin University, ANU, University of Canberra, KUET, and UITS. 
            My teaching expertise includes AI, cybersecurity, machine learning, computer vision, and networking. As an <a href="https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship/associate-fellowship">Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (AFHEA)</a>, 
            I emphasize interactive, research-driven, and project-based learning. I have successfully mentored PhD candidates, research assistants, and postdoctoral fellows, fostering a strong pipeline of AI and data science professionals.</p>
        
        <p>I actively bridge academia and industry, collaborating with CSIRO, <a href="https://careers.seeingmachines.com/">Seeing Machines</a>, <a href="https://www.natroad.com.au/">NatRoad Australia</a>, 
            <a href="https://www.encompass.asn.au/">Encompass Australia</a>, <a href="https://saltas.com.au/">SalTas</a>, <a href="https://fsfhg.health.wa.gov.au/">Fiona Stanley Hospital</a>,

            more to deliver AI-driven health monitoring, usability testing, and multimodal predictive analytics solutions. I have organized and chaired international conferences and workshops, including 
            <a href="https://www.iconip2023.org/web_invited_sessions.html">ICONIP 2023</a>, <a href="https://dicta2024.dictaconference.org/committee.html">DICTA 2024</a>, <a href="https://www2025.thewebconf.org/accepted-workshops">The Web Conference 2025</a>,
