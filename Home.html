            <p> I am a Senior Research Fellow at <a href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/md-zakir-hossain-4fd95ece/" target="_blank">the School of Electrical Engineering, Computing and Mathematical Sciences (EECMS)</a>, 
                Curtin University, with a past affiliation with the Optus-Curtin Centre of Excellence in AI. I also serve as a Visiting Fellow at the Australian National University (ANU)’s 
                <a href="https://bdsi.anu.edu.au/people">Biological Data Science Institute (BDSI)</a> and a Visiting Scientist at <a href="https://people.csiro.au/H/Z/zakir-hossain">Data61</a>, CSIRO. My research focuses on developing AI-driven solutions 
                for health informatics, affective computing, and privacy-preserving AI applications. With over a decade of experience in interdisciplinary research and teaching, I have contributed to machine learning, computer vision, and human-centered AI through academic, industry, and government collaborations.</p>
