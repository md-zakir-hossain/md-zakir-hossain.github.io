            <p> I am a Senior Research Fellow at <a href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/md-zakir-hossain-4fd95ece/" target="_blank">the School of Electrical Engineering, Computing and Mathematical Sciences (EECMS)</a>, 
                        Curtin University, with a past affiliation with the Optus-Curtin Centre of Excellence in AI. I also serve as a Visiting Fellow at the Australian National University (ANU)’s 
                        <a href="https://bdsi.anu.edu.au/people">Biological Data Science Institute (BDSI)</a> and a Visiting Scientist at <a href="https://people.csiro.au/H/Z/zakir-hossain">Data61</a>, CSIRO. 
                        My research focuses on developing AI-driven solutions for health informatics, affective computing, and privacy-preserving AI applications. With over a decade of experience in interdisciplinary research and teaching, 
                        I have contributed to machine learning, computer vision, and human-centered AI through academic, industry, and government collaborations.</p>
                        
             <p> Prior to joining Curtin University, I worked as a Research Fellow at <a href="https://bdsi.anu.edu.au/people">BDSI</a>, ANU and as a Visiting Scientist with 
                         <a href="https://bdsi.anu.edu.au/people">the Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence Future Science Platforms (MLAI FSP)</a> and 
                         <a href="https://people.csiro.au/H/Z/zakir-hossain">Agriculture and Food business</a> unit at CSIRO. I also served as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at 
                         <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/healthy-people/centres/australian-institute-of-health-innovation/aihi-research-centres/health-informatics">the Centre for Health Informatics (CHI)</a>, 
                         Macquarie University, Sydney. From 2018 to 2020, I worked as a Postdoctoral / Research Fellow and Lecturer at 
                         <a href="https://nceph.anu.edu.au/research/research-projects/our-health-our-hands-personalised-medicine-transforming-health-care">OHIOH (Our Health in Our Hands)</a> Grand Challenge and 
                         <a href="https://comp.anu.edu.au/">the Research School of Computer Science (RSCS)</a>, ANU. Additionally, I worked as a 
                         Human-Centered Computing Support Officer at the <a href="https://comp.anu.edu.au/">RSCS</a>, ANU at the end of my PhD. Before moving to Australia in 2015, I worked as a Lecturer and later as an Assistant Professor 
                         in the Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering (EEE) at <a href="https://www.kuet.ac.bd/dept/eee">Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET)</a>, Khulna, Bangladesh. 
                         Prior to that, I began my academic career as a Lecturer in EEE at the <a href="https://uits.edu.bd/department-of-electrical-electronic-engineering/"> University of Information Technology & Sciences (UITS)</a>, Dhaka, Bangladesh.</p>
        
            <p>Since 2012, I have taught over 20 university courses and supervised numerous students, including PhDs, master’s, and 
                honors students, at various institutions including the University of Information Technology & Sciences (UITS) and 
                Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET) in Bangladesh, as well as the University of Canberra, ANU, and 
                Curtin University. I am an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (AFHEA), awarded by the UK Advanced 
                Higher Education Academy. Through my teaching roles, I aim to foster critical thinking and innovation among students,
                drawing from my international experience and diverse academic background to enrich the learning environment.</p>
        
            <p>My research focuses on developing advanced technologies to address health-related challenges through responsible AI 
                and responsive AI frameworks. At Curtin University, I lead projects that create privacy-preserving AI approaches 
                for applications such as affective computing, emotion recognition, and predictive models for managing human 
                diseases. Previously, at ANU’s Biological Data Science Institute (BDSI) and as a Visiting Scientist at CSIRO, 
                I developed biologically informed machine learning models for predicting diseases in salmon and agricultural traits
                in wheat. My research spans a range of health-related AI applications, from diagnosing COVID-19 via acoustic 
                signals to building predictive models for individuals with chronic conditions like multiple sclerosis and diabetes.</p>
